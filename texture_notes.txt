Texture
===============================

1. Texture Wrapping
-------------------------------
- GL_REPEAT: The default behavior for textures. Repeats the texture image
- GL_MIRRORED_REPEAT: Same as GL_REPEAT but mirrors the image with each repeat
- GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE: Clamps the coordinates between 0 and 1. The result 
  is that higher coordinates become clamped to the edge, resulting
  in a stretched edge pattern 
- GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER: Coordinates outside the range are now given 
  a user-specified border color

2. MipMaps
-------------------------------
- GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST: takes the nearest mipmap to match 
  the pixel size and uses nearest neighbor interpolation for 
  texture sampling.
- GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_NEAREST: takes the nearest mipmap level and 
  samples that level using linear interpolation.
- GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_LINEAR: linearly interpolates between the two 
  mipmaps that most closely math the size of a pixel and samples
  the interpolated level via nearest neighbor interpolation. 
- GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR: linearly interpolates between the two 
  closest mipmaps and samples the interpolated level via 
  linear interpolation.
